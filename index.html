  <p>Joshua Ehimare is loved to animate ideas and see how they can be of benefit
    to his immediate environment. With our world today being transformed daily by
    brilliant inventions through computing, it is safe to say that our lives can be
    better with technology inputs.</p>
  <p>I have coding and design skills; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, UI/UX Design using
    Figma and Adobe XD. I also have experience with CMS (Content Management
    System) WordPress and Webflow. I have tried my hands-on troubleshooting and
    debugging web problems, removing malicious codes on websites.</p>
  <p>I am committed, loyal and empathetic to people and organisation. I am very
    focused on work, very composed, meticulous, love paying attention to details
    and I have a huge sense of humour; these forms my strength. It helps me
    savage frustrating working situations like debugging or cleaning PHP codes
    or JavaScript codes.
  </p>
  <p>I love to constantly challenge myself, therefore I keep learning and
    researching on how tech can influence my space. Watch this Space!</p>
